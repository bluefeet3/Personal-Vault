*Learning Plan*
Explain dislocations and point defects, explain the terms doping and domains. Give and example of structural phase transition in a crystal.
Calculate the point defect numbers.

### Crystal Imperfections
Although solids are **rigid**, they usually are flawed in some way. We call such flaws [[Crystal Defects|defects]].

The fact that crystals are **non-infinite** means that the lattice ultimately has an end point.

There are three main types of defect:
$\quad$- Grain boundaries
$\quad$- Dislocations
$\quad$- Point Defects

### [[Doping]]
Doping is a type of point defect imperfection.

Doping of materials to *change their properties* - e.g. to increase electrical conduction in a semiconductor such as silicon - is technologically very important.

### Structural Phase Transitions

**Perovskite** is a naturally occurring mineral, a prototype for many materials important in ferroelectrics.

*Below the [[Curie Temperature]]*, these crystals undergo *symmetry-distortions*.

The Distortions of BaTiO$_3$ :
There are three phase transitions in order of decreasing temperature.

**Above 120°C** BaTiO$_3$ is **cubic**.

**From 120°C down to ~5°C**, there is a distortion to a **tetragonal** phase.

**From 5°C down to around -90°C** the structure is **orthorhombic** by dilation along [110] directions and contraction along [1-10]. There are 12 possible orientations.

The **lowest temperatures** yield **rhombohedra** (distortions along the body diagonal), hence, eight equivalent distortion directions.
