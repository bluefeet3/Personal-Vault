For many materials the bonding is clearly *covalent* **not** *metallic*. e.g. Si, Ge, Organic conductors.

**Bonding** and **structure** are dominated by the *overlap / alignment* of atomic orbitals.

There is an expectation that the electrons are localised in **covalent bonds**.

NOTE: Do self research, lecture notes are unclear
