The set of points on which the [[Basis]] sits.

The lattice in three dimensions may be defined by **three translation vectors** $a_1$ , $a_2$ , $a_3$ , such that the arrangement of atoms in the crystal looks the same when viewed from the point $r$ as when viewed from every point $r_1$ translated by an integral multiple of the $a$â€™s:

$$\vec r' = \vec r + u_1 \vec a_1 + u_2 \vec a_2 + u_3 \vec a_3$$
