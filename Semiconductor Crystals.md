*Learning plan*
What are intrinsic semiconductors? 
Outline the properties of hole particles. 
Show an expression for the Law of mass action (carrier concentration) and that the Fermi level must fall at the centre of the band gap. 
Calculate carrier concentrations and occupancy probabilities.

### Band Gap
[[Semiconductor]]s are intermediate band gap materials which may conduct due to [[Thermal Excitation]] of electrons.

As the number of conduction electrons increases with temperature, the **resistance decreases** with increasing temperature (unlike metals).

### Thermal Excitation in Semiconductors
As an electron is excited to a higher state, a hole is left behind.

[[Holes]] move in applied electric and magnetic fields as if they have a positive charge: $+e$
