A type of [[Telescopes|Telescope]] to study radio [[Wavelength|wavelengths]].

The first observations in the radio range were made in 1932 by [[Jansky]].

Radio frequencies are between a few MHz (100 m) to around 300 GHz (1 mm).

The atmosphere limits the radio band:
- Low frequency is limited by the atmospheric [[Radiative Opacity|opacity]].
- High frequency is limited by the strong absorption from [[Oxygen]] and water bands.

Observations can be made in the continuum (broad-band) and in spectral lines (radio spectroscopy).

```ad-info
Most of our knowledge about the structure of the Milky Way comes from observations of the HI 21 cm line, and more recently from the 2.6 mm CO emssion line.

Radio signals are usually weak and need very sensitive receivers.

## LOFAR
LOFAR is the measurement of low frequency radio waves using [[Interferometry in Telescopes|interferometry]].

There is a LOFAR station in Birr in Ireland which is part of the [[International LOFAR Telescope]] (ILT).

LOFAR has two types of antennas:
- Low-frequency antennas (10-90 MHz)
- High-frequency antennas (110-250 MHz), more complex, typically encased in a styrofoam frame.

## Radio Astronomy
The most common antenna type is a parabolic reflector. 

At long wavelengths the reflecting surface does not need to be solid. However, at short wavelengths the surface must be smooth. Surface irregularities should be less than one tenth of the wavelength measured.

### Interferometry
Interferometry is a technique in radio astronomy to increase angular resolution, it is possible but more difficult in smaller wavelengths.
