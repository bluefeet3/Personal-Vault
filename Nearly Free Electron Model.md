#concept
• Derived as a deviation from free electron model.
• Basic view: electrons free to move through a metal as plane waves, but perturbed by a modest potential caused by the ion cores.
• Reasonable starting point model for many metals, where outer most electrons relatively weakly bonded to the atoms.

The structure of the ion lattice is dominated by packing of the ions and a trade off between potential energy gain (the closer the ions the stronger the average potential experienced by the electrons) and kinetic energy of the electrons – some metals (potassium, iron at room temperature) are b.c.c. not the close packed f.c.c. .
