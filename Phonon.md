Atoms vibrate about their mean position at a specific temperature. These vibrations produce vibrational waves inside the crystal.

Phonons are the quanta of these vibrational waves. They travel with a velocity of sound. Their wavelength is determined by the [[Crystal Lattice Constant]].

Phonons can only exist inside the crystal.
