What parameters are needed to define a Bravais lattice crystal.
Outline three examples of conventional cells based on the simple cubic lattice type.
Calculate the lattice constant.

### Periodic Array of Atoms
An ideal crystal is constructed from an infinite repetition of identical groups of atoms.
The structure of all crystals can be described in terms of a [[Lattice]], with a group of atoms attached to each lattice point called [[Basis]]:

### Translation Vectors
The lattice in three dimensions may be defined by **three translation vectors** $a_1$ , $a_2$ , $a_3$ , such that the arrangement of atoms in the crystal looks the same when viewed from the point $r$ as when viewed from every point $r_1$ translated by an integral multiple of the $a$â€™s:

$$\vec r' = \vec r + u_1 \vec a_1 + u_2 \vec a_2 + u_3 \vec a_3$$

### Primitive Unit Cell
The unit cell which has the *smallest volume* is called the **primitive unit cell**. A primitive unit cell is such that every lattice point of the lattice, without exception, can be represented by a translation vector.

The primitive unit cell that exhibits the **full symmetry** of the lattice is called [[Wigner-Seitz Cell]].
However, a conventional unit cell may contain more than one lattice point as shown above.

### Conventional Lattice
There are 14 possible types of lattice in 3D space. However, we will mainly consider cubic systems.

A [[Bravais Lattice]] is **invariant** under a translation.

Three basic cubic systems:
$\quad$- Simple Cubic
$\quad$- Body-Centred Cubic
$\quad$- Face-Centred Cubic (Highest packing efficiency)
