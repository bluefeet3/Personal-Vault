Every source seen from the telescope appears as a radially symmetric diffraction pattern.

## Diffraction Limit of a Telescope
Two images are unresolved when the central max of one pattern falls inside the location of the 1st minimum of the other.

The theoretical resolution of a telescope is often given in the form introduced by [[Lord Rayleigh]]:$$\frac{\Theta}{rad} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$$ where D is the telescope diameter and $\lambda$ the wavelength of the incident light.

As a practical rule, we say that two objects are separate if the angular distance between them is:$$\frac{\Theta}{rad} \ge \frac{\lambda}{D}$$
## How to make a telescope more accurate?
### Active Optics
Large telescopes have mirrors with very small thickness compared to their diameter. [[Active optics]] applies controlled forces to the primary mirror to correct for any errors.

### Adaptive Optics
[[Adaptive Optics]] corrects for the turbulence in the atmosphere. Similarly, deformable mirrors are used which are electronically controlled in real-time. This allows for imagery almost as sharp as if it were taken in space.

Adaptive Optics requires a bright reference star which is very close to the object being studied. This reference star is used to measure any blurring caused so that the mirror can be corrected.

Sometimes, there isn't an optimal star near the object. In cases like these, artificial stars can be created by shining a powerful laser beam into the upper atmosphere.
