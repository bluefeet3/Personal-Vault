$$\frac{dT}{dr} = -C \frac{\kappa \rho}{T^3} \frac{L_r}{4\pi r^2}$$ where $\kappa$ is the [[Mass Absorption Coefficient]], $\rho$ is density and C is a constant

The rate of change of temperature with respect to radius is negative, because the *temperature increases inwards.*

If energy is transported by radiation, there is a temperature gradient. Otherwise the radiation field would be the same in all directions and the net flux $F_r$ would vanish.

If the radiative transfer of energy becomes inefficient, the absolute value of the radiative temperature gradient becomes very large: convection becomes more efficient than radiation.

### What happens if convention takes over?
$$T \propto P^{1-\frac{1}{\gamma}}$$ where P is the pressure of the gas and $\gamma$ is the adiabatic exponent which is the ratio of the specific heats in constant pressure and constant volume.
$$\frac{dT}{dr} = \left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)\frac{T}{P}\frac{dP}{dr}$$

### Which gradient should be used?
In practice, the equation that results in the less steep temperature gradient is more accurate.
