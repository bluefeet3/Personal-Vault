# Time Scales
## Evolutionary Time Scales
There are three important basic time scales: 
$\quad$- The [[Nuclear Time Scale]] $t_n$
$\quad$- The [[Thermal Time Scale]] $t_t$
$\quad$- The [[Dynamical or Free-fall Time Scale]] $t_d$

# Star Formation
Stars are born within the [[Interstellar Medium]] inside giant clouds of gas and dust called **molecular clouds**.

## Molecular Clouds
Mostly comprised of 90% hydrogen and 9% helium with some other dusts (silicates and graphite), localised in the plane of the galaxy.

Very cold and dense. (10 to 50 K and $10^8$ to $10^{15}$ molecules per $m^3$).

A combination of the action of gravity and the conservation of angular momentum spin them inwards to form a denser spherical centre called [[Protostar]].

## Gravitational Collapse
The condensation of gas clouds into stars takes place in several stages. First the gas clod contracts. When it gets dense enough, smaller sections will be able to contract independently.

The could will fragment into many parts, each with a mass comparable to the solar mass which condense to form a cluster of low-mass protostars.

[[Virial Theorem]] describes the pressure needed to support a self gravitating body.

# Life on the Main Sequence
The only source of stellar energy is what is released by the *burning of hydrogen* in the **stellar core**.

The star is in **stable equilibrium**, and its structure only changes due to alterations in its chemical composition by nuclear reactions.

The evolution takes place on a [[Nuclear Time Scale]], this is the longest part of the star's lifetime.

Stars greater than $200\,\text{M}_\odot$ and less than $0.08 \,\text{M}_\odot$ cannot exist on the main sequence. Stars greater than $200\,\text{M}_\odot$ cannot create enough pressure to support their weight. Stars less than $0.08 \,\text{M}_\odot$ cannot burn hydrogen, but they can burn deuterium as in [[Brown Dwarfs]].

Stars on the upper end of the [[HR-Diagram]] burn through the [[CNO Cycle]], whereas stars on the lower end burn through the PP Chain.

## Upper Main Sequence
### Energy production through CNO:
Energy production through the [[CNO Cycle]] is very strongly *concentrated at the core*. Massive stars have a **convective core**, but outside the core, the energy is *carried by radiation* and there are no nuclear reactions.

### Evolution
The mass of the convective core will gradually diminish as the hydrogen is consumed. The star will slowly *shift towards the upper right* of the HR-diagram as its *luminosity grows* and its *surface temperature decreases*.

When the central hydrogen supply is finished, the core of the star will begin to **shrink rapidly**. The surface *temperature will increase* and the star will quickly *move towards the upper left*.

Because of the contraction of the core, the temperature in the hydrogen shell just outside the core will increase. It will soon be high enough for hydrogen to start

## Lower Main Sequence
### Energy production through the PP Chain:
The [[PP Chain]] occurs at a lower central temperature than that of more massive stars.

As the rate of the pp chain is *not as sensitive to temperature* as that of the the CNO Cycle, the *energy production is spread* over a larger region than in massive stars.
Because of this, the core never becomes consecutively unstable. The core of low-mass stars is **radiative**.

In the outer layers of lower main sequence stars, the opacity is high because of the low temperature. Radiation can then no longer carry all energy, and convection sets in.
