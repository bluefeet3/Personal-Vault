# Time Scales
## Evolutionary Time Scales
There are three important basic time scales: 
$\quad$- The **Nuclear Time Scale** $t_n$
$\quad$- The **Thermal Time Scale** $t_t$
$\quad$- The **Dynamical or Free-fall Time Scale** $t_d$

### The Nuclear Time Scale (Essentially Lifetime)
The time in which a star radiates away all the energy that can be released by nuclear reactions.

Around 0.7% of the rest mass is transformed into energy in the burning of hydrogen. $$t_n \approx \frac{0.007 \times 0.1 Mc^2}{L}$$ For the Sun, $t_n = 10^{10}$ years, hence: $$t_n \approx \frac{M/M_\odot}{L/L_\odot} \times 10^{10}$$
As $L \propto M^{3.5}$, **high mass stars** have a lower $t_n$ , *They burn up quickly*.

### The Thermal Time Scale
The time in which a star would radiate all its thermal energy if the **nuclear reactions stopped**.
It is also the time it takes for radiation from the centre to reach the surface.

As per the [[Virial Theorem]], the kinetic energy of the thermal motion of gas particles is half the potential energy, hence, the thermal time scale can be roughly estimated as: $$t_t \approx \frac{0.5 G M^2}{R L}$$$$t_t \approx \frac{(M/M_\odot)^2}{(R/R_\odot)(L/L_\odot)} \times 2\times10^7 \,\text{years}$$ where R is the stellar radius.

### The Free-Fall Time Scale
The time it would take for a star to collapse if the **internal pressure were removed**.

Note: This is the shortest time scale.

It can be estimated from the time it would take a particle to fall freely from the stellar surface to the centre. This is half the period. $$t_d = \frac{2\pi}{2}\sqrt{\frac{(R/2)^3}{GM}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{GM}}$$

# Star Formation
Stars are born within the [[Interstellar Medium]] inside giant clouds of gas and dust called **molecular clouds**.

## Molecular Clouds
Mostly comprised of 90% hydrogen and 9% helium with some other dusts (silicates and graphite), localised in the plane of the galaxy.

Very cold and dense. (10 to 50 K and $10^8$ to $10^{15}$ molecules per $m^3$).

A combination of the action of gravity and the conservation of angular momentum spin them inwards to form a denser spherical centre called [[Protostar]].

### Gravitational Collapse
The condensation of gas clouds into stars takes place in several stages. First the gas clod contracts. When it gets dense enough, smaller sections will be able to contract independently.

The could will fragment into many parts, each with a mass comparable to the solar mass which condense to form a cluster of low-mass protostars.

[[Virial Theorem]] describes the pressure needed to support a self gravitating body.

# The Main Sequence
#### Mass Limits 
Stars greater than $200\,\text{M}_\odot$ and less than $0.08 \,\text{M}_\odot$.

Stars on the upper end of the [[HR-Diagram]] burn through the CNO cycle, whereas stars on the lower end burn through the PP Chain.
