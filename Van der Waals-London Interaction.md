Consider *two identical inert gas atoms* at a separation R large in comparison with the radii of the atoms.
$$R >> r$$
These atoms *induce dipole moments* in each other which causes an attractive interaction between the atoms.
$$\Delta U = \frac{1}{2}\hbar \left( \Delta \omega_s + \Delta \omega_a \right)$$
$$\Delta U = -\hbar\omega_0 \cdot \frac{1}{8}\left( \frac{2e^2}{CR^3} \right)^2$$
$$\Delta U = \frac{-A}{R^6}$$
