Derived from the [[Van der Waals-London Interaction]] and the [[Repulsive Interaction]]
The total potential energy of two atoms at a separation R: $$U(R) = 4\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{R}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{R}\right)^6 \right]$$
With $A = 4\epsilon\sigma^6$ and $B = 4\epsilon\sigma^{12}$
