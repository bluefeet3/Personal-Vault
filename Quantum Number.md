*Principal Quantum number* – n – This number describes the **energy level** that the electron occupies. This defines the “level” of the electron.

*Orbital Quantum Number* – l – (Azimuthal) this number describes the **shape of the orbital** that the electron is found in. 
It can have a value from 0-3. This defines the “sublevel” of the electron. 
Also, the numbers can be replaced by letters according to the following: a. 0 = s b. 1 = p c. 2 = d d. 3 = f

*Spin Quantum Number* – $m_s$ – this number describes the **direction of spin** of the electron in the orbital – electrons in the same level and sublevel must spin in opposite directions. 
This can have a value of +1/2 or –1/2 only.

*Magnetic Quantum Number* - $m_l$ – this number describes the **orientation of the electrons** in the orbitals. This defines the “orbital” of the electron. There are 2l+1 orbitals in each sublevel. 
This quantum number can have the following values: (-l to +l)

a. If l = 0, ml can equal 0 
b. If l = 1, ml can equal –1, 0, +1 
c. If l = 2, ml can equal –2, -1, 0, +1, +2 
d. If l = 3, ml can equal –3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3
