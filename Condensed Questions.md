## Semiconductors
### Intrinsic
Define what an intrinsic semiconductor is

Show and expression for Fermi distribution in an intrinsic semiconductor.
- Note the law of mass action, $n_1^2 = \cdot\cdot\cdot$

Calculate the concentration of carriers in intrinsic semiconductors in the valence band.

### Extrinsic
Define what an extrinsic semiconductor is
- Doping types, diagrammatically, how they affect the bands.

NO DERIVATION
Be familiar with the ability to calculate dopant concentrations.
- Majority and minority carriers.

Relate Fermi level to extrinsic semiconductors

### Temperature and Mobility
Mobility against concentration of impurities diagram.
- Noting the effect of impurity scattering

Extrinsic and intrinsic carrier concentration as a function of temperature.

### PN Junction
Outline forward and reverse bias along with unbiased.
- Referencing shockley/ideal diode equation
- Current against voltage diagram
