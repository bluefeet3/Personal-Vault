#equation
Describes the ratio of populations of atoms at different levels of ionisation.

If collisions dominate, the equation that regulates ionisation is called the [[Saha Equation]]: $$ \frac{n_{i+1}}{n_i} = \frac{2\, Z_{i+1}}{n_e \,Z_i}\left( \frac{2 \pi m_e kT}{h^2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}  \exp\left( -\frac{\chi_{i}}{kT} \right)$$**Where:**
$\chi_{i}$ is the ionising energy of ion $i$ from its fundamental energy level.
$Z$ is the [[Partition Function]]
$T$ is the excitation temperature
$k$ [[Boltzmann Constant]]
$n_e$ is the number density of free electrons
$N$ is the number of atoms.

The factor of 2 in front of the partition function $Z_{i+1}$ reflects the two possible spins of the free electron.
