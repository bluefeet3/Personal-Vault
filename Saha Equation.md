#equation
Describes the ratio of populations of atoms at different levels of ionisation.

If collisions dominate, the equation that regulates ionisation is called the [[Saha Equation]]: $$ \frac{n_{i+1}}{n_i} = \frac{1}{n_e}\left( \frac{2 \pi m_e kT}{h^2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \frac{2 U_{i+1}}{U_i} \exp\left( -\frac{E_{ion}}{kT} \right)$$**Where:**
$E_{ion}$ is the ionising energy of ion $i$ from its fundamental energy level.
$U$ is the [[Partition Function]]
$T$ is the excitation temperature
$k$ [[Boltzmann Constant]]
