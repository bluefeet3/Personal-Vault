$$\frac{dT}{dr} = -C \frac{\kappa \rho}{T^3} \frac{L_r}{4\pi r^2}$$ where $\kappa$ is the [[Mass Absorption Coefficient]], $\rho$ is density and C is a constant

The rate of change of temperature with respect to radius is negative, because the temperature increases inwards.
If energy is transported by radiation, there is a temperature gradient. Otherwise the radiation field would be the same in all directions and the net flux $F_r$ would vanish.
If the radiative transfer of energy becomes inefficient, the absolute value of the radiative temperature gradient becomes very large: convection becomes more efficient than radiation.
