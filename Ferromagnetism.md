Outline ferromagnetism and the exchange field, temperature dependence of magnetisation and susceptibility.
Outline hysteresis.

## Hysteresis Loop
See hyperphysics

# Magnetic Domain
Within each domain the magnetisation is uniform and equal to the spontaneous magnetisation. Different domains are magnetised in different directions.

Hence in a ferromagnetic material, the average magnetisation of a sample can be 0 with the appropriate domain configuration.

**Why are they subdivided into domains?**
## Exchange Energy
The energy responsible for ferromagnetism of magnetic materials. The exchange coupling between nearest neighbours is significant and results in parallel alignment.

### The Exchange Field

## Domain Walls
We must consider the boundary between neighbouring domains. The width of the domain wall is qualitatively determined by the balance between the exchange energy and the anisotropy energy.
