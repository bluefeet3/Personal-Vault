Electrons behave like having the magnetic field of spinning charged particles. They are deflected by magnets.

In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, a stream of electron are passed between two magnets deflecting them to a point on a screen.

Classically, if electrons were actually spinning charged particles, they could be orientated in any direction. Hence, what is expected is a range of deflections from the top of the screen to the bottom in a continuous pattern.

However, what is observed is that the electrons collect in two discrete spots on the screen, one corresponding to spin up, and one corresponding to spin down.

This can be repeated for any direction.
