The **long-range interaction** between ions with charge Â±q is the electrostatic interaction $\pm \frac{q^2}{r}$, attractive between ions of opposite charge and repulsive between ions of the same charge.
The ions arrange themselves in whatever crystal structure gives the *strongest attractive interaction compatible with the repulsive interaction* at short distances between ion cores.

The repulsive interactions between ions with inert gas configurations are similar to those between inert gas atoms.

The [[Van der Waals-London Interaction|Van der Waals]] part of the attractive interaction in ionic crystals makes a relatively small contribution to the cohesive energy in ionic crystals, of the order of 1 or 2 percent. 

The **main contribution** to the binding energy of ionic crystals is electrostatic and is called the [[Madelung energy]].
