$$\Delta x \Delta p_x \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

Proof in notes using the [[Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality]]
### Commutation Relations
$$[\hat P_x , \hat X] \equiv \hat P_x \hat X - \hat X \hat P_x = -i\hbar$$
For [[Hermitian Operator]]s, the commutation relation is [[Complex Numbers|complex]].

### Compatibility
Two physical observables are said to be compatible if the operators have a common  
set of eigenfunctions.

The uncertainty principle applies for any non-compatible [[Operator]]s.

##### Generalised Uncertainty
$$\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 \ge \left( \frac{1}{2i} \braket{[\hat A, \hat B]} \right)^2$$

### Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle
Here $\Delta t$ represents the *time a system takes to change* substantially.

Δt depends on which observable is being considered, and will generally be different for  
different observables.
However, if ΔE is small, then the rate of change of all other  
observables will be slow (Δt large). Conversely, if any observable changes rapidly, the  
uncertainty in the energy must be large.
