How do covalent bonding interactions occur with regard to their wavefunctions forming bonding and anti bonding states.
In contrast how do metallic systems interact, explain using lithium as an example referring to the kinetic and potential energy of the system and how such effects relate bonding of the lithium lattice (compared to the isolated atom). 
Use the electric dipole moment to calculate the degree of ‘covalent-ness’.

### Covalent or Ionic?
When two identical atoms bond, as in homonuclear diatomic molecules such as O2 or N2 , the bonding is purely covalent.
Since the wave functions of the *two atoms are exactly alike*, neither atom dominates and the electrons are completely shared between them.

However, the bonding of *two dissimilar atoms* is often a mixture of covalent and ionic bonding.
Even in NaCl, the electron donated by sodium to chlorine has some probability of being at the sodium atom because its wave function does not suddenly fall to zero. Thus, this electron is partially shared in a covalent bond, although this bonding is only a small part of the total bond, which is mainly ionic.

A measure of the degree to which a bond is ionic or covalent can be obtained from the [[Electric Dipole Moment]] of the molecule. 

For example, if the bonding in NaCl were purely ionic, the centre of positive charge would be at the Na+ ion and the centre of negative charge would be at the Cl- ion. The electric dipole moment would have the magnitude:
$$p_{ionic} = er_0$$where $r_0$ is the equilibrium separation of the ions.

### Metals
Bonding in metallic solids: *the valence electrons are delocalized throughout the crystal*, providing a strong cohesive force that holds the metal atoms together. The strength of metallic bonds varies dramatically.
(Think about the melting temperatures of metals)

In this model, the valence electrons are not tightly bound to any one atom but are distributed uniformly throughout the structure.
