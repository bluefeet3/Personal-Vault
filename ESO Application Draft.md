- Computational stuff
- I want to try research to see if something like a phd is for me
- Great funding so can really focus on the research itself
- What do I have to offer
- Give examples
- Professional Objectives

My name is Daragh Hollman. I am exceptionally interested in doing research in the summer internship position at ESO Garching. As a physics student specialising in astronomy and space science, the prospect of working at ESO excites me. I have always been passionate about space science and believe my experiences in programming, Y, and Z make me an ideal candidate to the program. All the projects available are incredibly inciting however two in particular stand out: Projects E and F. These projects both greatly appeal to a passion of mine - Computational Physics - which I have found little opportunity to explore within my course to date at University College Dublin. [I am enthralled by the concept of modelling physical processes...]
Learning is a huge motivator for me, I find improving my skill-set incredibly gratifying. I think this programme will be a great environment in which to further hone my programming and computational analysis skills.
I believe that ESO offers a fantastic opportunity for me to gain great experience at the forefront of astronomy research with its world-renowned facility and equipment.

The funding and accommodation that this programme provides would enable me to focus purely on the science itself and fully embrace the experience without worrying about having to find extra work to help pay for living abroad.
