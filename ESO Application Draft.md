# Motivation
Please describe your motivation for applying to the programme (<1500 characters, all entries in excess of this limit will automatically be truncated before evaluation.)

I am seeking an internship this summer to get some practical experience in research before committing to a specific career path. The programme offered by ESO Garching is particularly appealing. 

As a physics student specialising in astronomy and space science, the prospect of working at ESO excites me. I have always been passionate about space science and believe my experiences in programming, problem solving and innovation makes me an ideal candidate for the program. All the projects available sound fascinating - however two in particular stand out for me: Projects E and F. These projects both greatly appeal to a passion of mine - computational physics. 

Learning is a huge motivator for me. I think this programme offers an environment to further hone my programming and analytical skills and a fantastic opportunity to gain great experience at the forefront of astronomy research.

The funding and accommodation that this programme provides would enable me to focus purely on the programme itself and fully embrace the experience without worrying about having to find extra work to help pay for living abroad. This sets ESO Garching out from most other institutions offering internships that I have seen. In addition to this, this internship presents an amazing opportunity to embrace a different culture and language. I am passionate about linguistics, and I am currently learning Dutch in my spare time. I would love the opportunity to learn and practice some German.
