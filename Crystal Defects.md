There are three main types of defect:
$\quad$- Grain boundaries
$\quad$- Dislocations
$\quad$- Point Defects

*Note: Defects are not always a bad thing.*

### Grain Boundaries
Poorly ordered regions in crystals or alloys where crystallites of different orientations meet.

### Point Defects

**Vacancy** - Where an atom is missing from a lattice site

**Interstitial** - Where an extra atom exists in the crystal but not on a lattice site.

**Frenkel Pair** - When an atom leaves a lattice site to form an interstitial.

**Substitutional Atoms** - Are dissimilar atoms occupying a lattice site.
