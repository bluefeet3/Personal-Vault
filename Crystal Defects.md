There are three main types of defect:
$\quad$- Grain boundaries
$\quad$- Dislocations
$\quad$- Point Defects

*Note: Defects are not always a bad thing.*

### Grain Boundaries
Poorly ordered regions in crystals or alloys where crystallites of different orientations meet.

### Point Defects

**Vacancy** - Where an atom is missing from a lattice site : [[Schottky Defects]]

**Interstitial** - Where an extra atom exists in the crystal but not on a lattice site.

**Frenkel Pair** - When an atom leaves a lattice site to form an interstitial. : [[Frenkel Defects]]

**Substitutional Atoms** - Are dissimilar atoms occupying a lattice site.

##### Energy for point defect formation
Energy is required to form a defect ([[Endothermic Process]])

Although there is a cost in *energy*, there is a gain in *entropy* in the formation of a defect.

At equilibrium, the overall change in free energy is zero according to [[Gibbs Free Energy]]: $$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$$
At any temperature, there will always be an equilibrium population of defects. Where the number of defects (for an MX crystal) is: $$n_s \approx N \exp{\left(\frac{-\Delta H_s}{2kT}\right)}$$
where $n_s$ is the number of [[Schottky Defects]] per unit volume, with N cation and N anion sites per unit cell.

The number of [[Frenkel Defects]] present in an MX crystal is: $$n_F \approx (NN_i)^{\frac{1}{2}} \exp{\left(\frac{-\Delta H_F}{2kT}\right)}$$
