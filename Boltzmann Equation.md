#equation 
The atomic [[Energy Levels]] of a given ion are populated inversely exponentially as a function of their energy. That is, lower energy levels are naturally more populated than higher energy levels.

The population number $n_i$ of an energy state $i =$ number of atoms per unit volume.
In thermal equilibrium, the population numbers follow a [[Boltzmann Distribution]]:$$\frac{n_i}{n_0} = \frac{g_i}{g_0}\cdot\exp\left( \frac{-\Delta E}{kT} \right)$$
where $T \approx T_{exc}\,$ excitation temperature and $k =$ [[Boltzmann Constant]], and $g_i$ is the statistical weight of level $i$.
