# What is a Hard Magnetic Material
Hard magnetic materials are those that maintain a **constant magnetism** after magnetisation.
Hard magnetic materials are sometimes also described as **permanent magnetic materials**.

## Properties
- High [[Coercivity]]
- Low [[Permeability]]
- For these reasons it is difficult to demagnetise these materials.
- The area of the [[Hysteresis Loop]] is large.
- Widely used for making permanent magnets.
