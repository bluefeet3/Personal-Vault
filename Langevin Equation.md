#equation 
Used to estimate the [[Magnetic Susceptibility]] in [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic systems]].
$$\chi = \frac{\mu_0 N \mu}{B} = \frac{\mu_0 N Z e^2}{6 m} \left<r^2\right>$$ where $N$ is the number of atoms per unit volume, $Z$ is the atomic number, $e$ is the fundamental charge, $m$ is the mass of the electron and $r$ is the inter-atomic spacing.
