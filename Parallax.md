### In Astronomy

Parallax is the *apparent shift* of the position of an object against a background of more distant objects.

To determine the distance to a nearby star, astronomers use parallax to measure its [[Angular Displacement]] from both sides of the Earth.

**Annual Parallax** is half the Angular Displacement of a star observed at intervals of 6 months.

In [[Parsec|parsecs]] and arcseconds:
