In fusion reactions, light elements are transformed into heavier elements.

The production of elements heavier than iron requires an input of energy and therefore they cannot be produced by thermonuclear reactions.

### Proton-Proton Chain
In sun-like stars, the energy is produced by the proton-proton chain.

$$\ce{^1{H}} + \ce{^1{H}} \to \ce{^2{H}} + e^+ + \nu_e$$
$$\ce{^2{H}} + \ce{^1{H}} \to \ce{^3{He}} + \gamma$$
$$\ce{^3{He}} + \ce{^3{He}} \to \ce{^4{He}} + 2\ce{^1{H}}$$
For each reaction 3, reactions 1 and 2 need to happen twice.

##### Reaction 1:
The first step has a very low probability to occur. In pressure and temperature conditions at the centre of the Sun, a proton takes $10^{10}$ years to collide with another proton.

The [[Neutrino]] ($\nu_e$) produced in reaction 1 can escape the Sun carrying some energy.

The [[Positron]] ($e^+$) is annihilated with an electron producing two gamma quanta.

##### Reaction 2:
This reaction is much faster than reaction 1. Thus there is very little deuterons inside stars.

##### Reaction 3:
Last step can take 3 different forms. The PPL chain just described is the most probable one. It produces 91% of the energy in the sun.

### The Carbon Cycle
Above 20 million degrees and for stars with mass 1.5 times that of the sun, the dominant cycle is the CNO.

The CNO reaction rate increases with temperature.

Note: Step 4 is the slowest reaction. At 20 million degrees it takes ~1 million years.

### The Triple Alpha Reaction
The abundance of He increased as a consequence of the PP chain and CNO cycle.

At temperatures greater that $10^8$ K, He can be transformed into Carbon following the triple alpha reaction.

$$\ce{^4{He}}+\ce{^4{He}} \to \ce{^8{Be}}$$
$$\ce{^8{Be}} + \ce{^4{He}} \to \ce{^12{C}} + \gamma$$

The Be is unstable and decays into two He nuclei or alpha particles. To produce carbon, we need the collision almost simultaneously of the 3 particles.

Once He is burned out, other reactions are possible at higher temperatures.
The heaviest element produced in reactions is Fe.
