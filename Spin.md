Magnetic dipole moment:$$\hat{\mu} = \frac{-e}{2m}\hat{L}$$
Spectroscopy experiments lead to seeing the $l=1$ state being split into 4, and the $l=2$ state into 2 because of the magnetic field.

Spin is another kind of angular momentum which is unrelated to spatial  angular momentum.

[[Stern-Gerlach Experiment]]

The spin of a particle **does not change**.
## Spin Operators


## Pauli Spin Matrices
There exists a $\sigma$ for each $S$ such that:
$$S = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma$$
$$\sigma_x \equiv \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1\\ 1 & 0 \end{array}\right)    \quad\quad    \sigma_y \equiv \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -i\\ i & 0 \end{array}\right)  \quad\quad    \sigma_z \equiv \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\\ 0 & -1 \end{array}\right)$$
