## Question A
##### (a) Outline the effect of temperature on intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors with respect to carrier density. In your answer use diagrams where required.

In intrinsic semiconductors, the carrier density is derived from the Fermi distribution to be as follows:$$n_i^2 = N_V N_C \exp{\left(\frac{-E_g}{kT}\right)}$$and hence the carrier density of an intrinsic semiconductor has a temperature dependence of: $$n_i \propto \sqrt{\exp{\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)}}$$
The same proportionality holds for extrinsic semiconductors as their carrier density is proportional to $n_i$, however the concentrations of acceptor and donor impurities also affect the carrier density by the following equations:$$n_{n} = \frac{1}{2}\left[N_D - N_A + \sqrt{(N_D-N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}\right]$$and $$n_{p} = \frac{1}{2}\left[N_A - N_D + \sqrt{(N_A-N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}\right]$$
##### (b) For intrinsic semiconductors: Derive and expression for the position of the Fermi level ($E_F$) with respect to the conduction band edge ($E_c$). Star the derivation from the following expressions for the concentration of electrons and holes at the conduction band edge, where $N_V$ and $N_C$ are the effective density of states.$$n_0 = N_C\,exp{\left(\frac{-(E_C - E_F)}{kT}\right)} \quad\quad p_0 = N_V\,exp{\left(\frac{-(E_F - E_V)}{kT}\right)}$$$$$$
Multiplying the two equations it follows that:$$np = N_VN_C\,\exp{\left(\frac{-(E_C-E_V)}{kT}\right)} = N_VN_C \, \exp{\left(\frac{-E_g}{kT}\right)}$$Where $E_g$ is the band gap energy.

The intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$ is defined as:$$n_i^2 = N_VN_C \, \exp{\left(\frac{-E_g}{kT}\right)}$$
