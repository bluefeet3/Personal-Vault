The Drude Model describes conduction in metals.

Free electrons move through a crystal under an electric field.

The model assumes that the electrons collide with atoms in the lattice and that this can be used to describe the conductivity (and electronic heat capacity) - like a pinball machine.

The average distance between collisions is known as the [[Mean Free Path]] which is approximately equal to the **interatomic spacing**.

Electrons move with a drift velocity (imposed by the E-field) as well as a random thermal velocity. ([[Brownian Motion]])
