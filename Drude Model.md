The Drude Model describes conduction in metals.

Free electrons move through a crystal under an electric field.

The model assumes that the electrons collide with atoms in the lattice and that this can be used to describe the conductivity (and electronic heat capacity) - like a pinball machine.

The average distance between collisions is known as the [[Mean Free Path]] which is approximately equal to the **interatomic spacing**.

Electrons move with a drift velocity (imposed by the E-field) as well as a random thermal velocity. ([[Brownian Motion]])

# Ohm's Law Relation
Ohm's law states that the electrical conductivity of a metal is directly proportional to the electric current passing through it. This relationship can be understood through the Drude model by considering the equation for the electrical conductivity of a metal, which is given by:

$$\sigma = {ne^2\over m}$$

where Ïƒ is the electrical conductivity of the metal, n is the number of free electrons per unit volume of the metal, e is the charge of an electron, and m is the mass of an electron.

In the Drude model, it is assumed that the number of free electrons in the metal is constant, and that these electrons are able to move freely and randomly throughout the metal. As the electric current passing through the metal increases, the number of electrons moving through the metal also increases, leading to an increase in the electrical conductivity of the metal.

This relationship can be expressed using Ohm's law, which states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current passing through it. This can be written as:

V = IR

where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance of the metal.

If we combine the equations for electrical conductivity and Ohm's law, we can see that the electrical conductivity of a metal is directly proportional to the voltage across the metal, and that this relationship is governed by the number of free electrons in the metal and the resistance of the metal. This provides a simple explanation for the relationship between electric current and conductivity in metals, and shows how the Drude model can be used to understand Ohm's law.
