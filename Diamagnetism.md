In *diamagnetic materials* the [[Magnetic Susceptibility]] is negative. Usually of magnitude order between $-10^{-6}$ to $-10^{-5}$.

The negative value means that in an applied magnetic field, these materials acquire the magnetisation pointed opposite to the applied field.

The susceptibility in these materials is nearly **constant** with respect to temperature.

[[Ionic Crystals]], [[Noble Metals]] and inert gas atoms are diamagnetic. These substances have atoms or ions with complete shells. Their diamagnetic behaviour is due to the fact that a magnetic field acts to distort the orbital motion.

**Classical Interpretation**: The [[Coulomb Force]] provides the centripetal force on the electron. When the flux through an electric circuit loop is changed, an induced current is created in a direction to oppose the charge ([[Lenz's Law]]).

Diamagnetism is then associated with the tendency of electrical charges to **partially shield** the interior of a body from an applied magnetic field.

**All other classes** of materials have **positive susceptibility**.
