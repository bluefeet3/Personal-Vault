#equation 
$$PV = nRT$$where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is number of moles, $R$ is the [[Molar Gas Constant]] and $T$ is the temperature.

Another form is as follows:$$PV = Nk_B T$$where $N = nN_A$ is the number of particles and $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann Constant]].

## Astrophysics
The ideal law, or the **Perfect Gas Law** is often written in astrophysics in terms of the **Electron Number Density** $n_e$ in the following way:$$P_e = n_ekT$$
This is the pressure of free electrons.
