Paramagnetic materials have a positive [[Magnetic Susceptibility]].

Atoms, molecules, and lattice defects possessing an odd number of electrons, free atoms and ions, some even electron compounds, and metals are all paramagnetic.

### Magnetic Susceptibility in Paramagnetism
$$\chi_p = \frac{N p^2 \mu_B^2}{3k_B T}$$where $p$ is the effective number of Bohr magnetons $p \equiv g[j(j+1)]^{1/2}$.
