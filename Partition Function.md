The partition function is the **weighted sum** of the number of ways the atom can arrange its electrons with the same energy, with more energetic (and therefore less likely) configurations receiving less weight from the [[Boltzmann Equation|Boltzmann Factor]] when the sum is taken.

The partition function is defined as: $$Z = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} g_j e^{-(E_j - E_1)}$$where $E_j$ is the energy of the $j$th energy level and $g_i$ is the degeneracy of that level.
