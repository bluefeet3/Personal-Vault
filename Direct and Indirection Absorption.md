## Direct
In a direct absorption process the threshold of continuous optical absorption at frequency $\omega_g$ is equal to the band game.
$$E_g = \hbar \omega_g$$
A photon is absorbed with the creation of an electron and a hole.

The minimum of the **conduction band** and the maximum of the **valance band** both lie at the same momentum, k.
When the electron at the bottom of the CB recombines with the hole in the VB there is no change in momentum. 
**Energy is conserved** by emitting a photon. This is called a **Radiative Transition**.

Strong absorption for $\hbar\omega \gt E_g$

## Indirect
Involves a [[Phonon]] as well as a photon to make the transition.
$$\hbar \omega_g = E_g + \hbar \Omega$$ where $\Omega$ is the frequency of the phonon.
The phonon energy of $\hbar \Omega$ will generally be much less than $E_g$.

The minimum of the CB and the maximum of the VB both lie at different k-values. When an electron and hole recombine **phonons** must be involved to conserve momentum.

This is *less efficient* than a direct band transition.

$$E_f = E_i + \hbar\omega \pm \hbar \Omega$$

title: Phonon Temperature Dependence
As temperature decreases, the phonon count decreases gradually. At very low temperature, no phonons exist with enough energy.
