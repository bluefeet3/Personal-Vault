## Harvard Classification Scheme
The **Harvard classification scheme**: O B A F G K M. This set is further broken down numerically such as, B4 and K9.

Stars nearer the beginning of this sequence are known as **early-type** stars as opposed to **late-type** stars being later in this sequence.

### Henry Draper Catalogue
"Today, many stars are referred to by their HD numbers; Betelgeuse is HD 39801."
-D. A. Ostlie.

### But what is the physical basis?
[[Absorption Lines]] are created when *an atom absorbs a photon* with exactly the energy required for an [[Electron]] to move from a lower to a higher orbit.

[[Emission Lines]] are formed in the *exact opposite process*; A photon carries away the energy from a downwards orbital transition.

The distinctions between spectra of stars of different temperatures are due to electrons occupying different orbitals. The details of what defines each spectral type then becomes complicated as electrons can be found in any orbit, and, the atom can be in any stage of [[Ionisation]].

#### Defining Qualities of Spectral Types
Taken from Table 8.1 of An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics by D. A. Ostlie.

| Spectral Type | Characteristics                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| O             | Hottest blue-white stars with few lines<br> Strong He II absorption (sometimes emission) lines<br> He I absorption lines becoming stronger                    |
| B             | Hot blue-white<br> He I absorption lines strongest at B2<br> H I (Balmer) absorption lines becoming stronger                                                  |
| A             | White<br> Balmer absorption lines strongest at A0, becoming weaker later<br> Ca II absorption lines becoming stronger                                         |
| F             | Yellow-white<br> Ca II lines continue to strengthen as Balmer lines continue to weaken<br>Neutral metal absorption lines (Fe I, Cr I)                         |
| G             | Yellow<br> Solar-type spectra<br> Ca II lines continue to strengthen as Balmer lines continue to weaken<br> Fe I, other neutral metal lines becoming stronger |
| K             | Cool orange<br> Ca II H and K lines strongest at K0, becoming weaker later<br> Spectra dominated by metal absorption lines                                    |
| M             | Cool red<br> Spectra dominated by molecular absorption bands, especially titanium oxide and vanadium oxide<br> Neutral metal absorption lines remain strong   |
