The **Stellar Atmosphere** is the outer region of ~1% of the stellar radius.

It is assumed that the properties of the medium only vary radially. (z)

While studying stellar atmospheres, the optical depth is usually defined as:$$d\tau_\nu = -\alpha_\nu dz$$ because:
$\quad$- z increases inwards
$\quad$- [[Optical depth]] increases inwards
