The **Stellar Atmosphere** is the outer region of ~1% of the stellar radius.

It is assumed that the properties of the medium only vary radially. (z)

While studying stellar atmospheres, the optical depth is usually defined as:$$d\tau_\nu = -\alpha_\nu dz$$ because:
$\quad$- z increases inwards
$\quad$- [[Optical Depth]] increases inwards

Note the frequency dependence.

### Spectral Line Formation
$I_\nu (\tau_\nu) = I_\nu (0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + B_\nu[T](1-e^{-\tau_\nu})$

$\tau_\nu$ is a very important parameter and it tells us immediately if the slab of atmosphere that we are considering falls into one of these two regimes:
$\quad$ - Optically thin ($\tau_\nu \ll 1$)
$\quad$ - Optically thick ($\tau_\nu \gg 1$

considering $I_\nu(0) = 0$ :
##### Optically Thin $\tau_\nu \ll 1$:
Optical depth is related to [[Radiative Opacity|opacity]]: $d\tau = -\alpha_\nu dz$
There is a **low** **chance** that a photon will interact with a particle. We can "see" through our slab of atmosphere.
$(1-e^{\tau_\nu}) \to \tau_\nu$
$$I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = B_\nu [T] \tau_\nu$$
The radiation intensity from the cloud is large at frequencies where the absorption coefficient is large.

##### Thick $\tau_\nu \gg 1$:
Optical depth is related to [[Radiative Opacity|opacity]]: $d\tau = -\alpha_\nu dz$
There is a **high** **chance** that a photon will interact with a particle. We cannot "see" through our slab of atmosphere.
$(1-e^{\tau_\nu}) \to 1$
$$I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = B_\nu [T]$$
An optically thick slab can be approximated as a [[Blackbody]].

The **rate of change of opacity** gives rise to the stellar continuum and gives rise to [[Spectral Lines]].

### Hence:
$$equation \, here$$
The intensity of a blackbody increases at all frequencies as temperature grows.

If temperature out is greater than temperature in: The outgoing intensity is larger at frequencies where $\tau_\nu$ is greatest, hence [[Absorption Lines]].

Else: [[Emission Lines]]
