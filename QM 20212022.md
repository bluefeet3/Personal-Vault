##### Give an account of the concept of electron spin and outline how its existence was verified experimentally in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

Electron Spin is a type of quantum mechanical angular momentum different to orbital angular momentum. In simple terms, the electron acts as if it were rotating in a magnetic field.

In the Stern-Gerlach experiment a beam of neutral atoms was passed through a magnetic field. Atoms were deflected according to the orientation of their magnetic moments relative to the field.

If only orbital angular momentum existed, the deflections would split the beam into an odd number ($2l+1$) of components. However, some atomic beams were split into even numbers of components.
If ($2 j + 1$) is equal to an even number then $j$ must be a half integer, suggesting half integer angular momentum which cannot be understood within the formulation of classical models.
