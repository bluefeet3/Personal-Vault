There are *6 main equations* which describe the stellar structure:

##### [[Stellar Hydrostatic Equilibrium]]:
Stars are **stable structures** and changes aren't observed.
There is a mechanical equilibrium in stars known as Hydrostatic Equilibrium.
$$\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{Gm(r)\rho(r)\,}{r^2}$$
[[Radiative Energy Transport]]
[[Stellar Nuclear Reactions]]
[[Stellar Atmospheres and Spectral Line Formation]]
## Internal Equilibrium Conditions
[[Stellar Temperature Gradient]]

## Boundary Conditions
In order to solve the set of differential equations e need some boundary conditions:

There are no energy or mass sources at the centre, at $r=0$, $M_0 = 0, L_0=0$
The total mass at radius R is fixed.
Temperature and pressure at the stellar surface are approximated to be 0.

## Physical State of the Gas
The temperature at the stellar interior is very high, and thus the gas is completely ionised.
The perfect gas approximation is valid, as the interaction between particle is very small:
$$P =\frac{k \rho T}{\mu} + P_{rad}$$where k is the [[Boltzmann Constant]], $m_H$ is the mass of the Hydrogen atom and $\mu$ the mean molecular weight in **units** of $m_H$
$$\mu = \frac{1}{2X + \frac{3}{4}Y + \frac{1}{2}Z}$$ where X is Hydrogen, Y Helium and Z all other elements.
At high pressures, the [[Radiative Pressure]] must be included:
$$P_{rad} = \frac{1}{3} a T^4$$where $a$ is the [[Radiation Density Constant]].

```ad-note
title: What happens at very high densities
At very high densities ($\gt 10^7 \,\text{kg m}^{-3}$) the perfect gas law is invalid and the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] becomes relevant.
We then say that the matter is **degenerate**.
