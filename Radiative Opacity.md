Opacity is a physical quantity that depends on frequency.

It measures the **capability** of matter to absorb or [[Scattering|scatter]] photons, and hence the ability to prevent radiation from passing through.

Low density regions have lower opacity, meaning photons flow through them easier. High density regions have high opacity and photons are often *scattered*.

Opacity depends on the *chemical composition, temperature, and density* of the gas.

$$\alpha = \kappa \rho$$ where $\rho$ is the gas density and $\kappa$ is the [[Mass Absorption Coefficient]]; $[\kappa] = [m^2 \, kg^{-1}]$

##### Notes on Opacity
The inverse of the opacity represents the [[Mean Free Path]] of the radiation in the medium.

(Radiative) Opacity measures the *capability of matter to absorb or scatter* radiation.

##### There are 4 types of opacity interactions:
[[Bound-Bound Transitions]]
[[Bound-Free Transitions]]
[[Free-Free Transitions]]
[[Scattering]] of photons

### How to determine Opacity?
How to compute opacities is still a major issue in astrophysics. It requires major codes/simulations.

It is very important to determine the template structure of an atmosphere because it controls how easily the energy can flow at a given wavelength.
The opacity is determined by how the photons interact with particles.

If opacity changes slowly with wavelength, it determines the stellar continuum. Sharp changes in opacity will give rise to [[Spectral Lines]].
