Opacity is a physical quantity that depends on frequency.

It measures the **capability** of matter to absorb or [[Scattering|scatter]] photons, and hence the ability to prevent radiation from passing through.

Low density regions have lower opacity, meaning photons flow through them easier. High density regions have high opacity and photons are often *scattered*.

Opacity depends on the *chemical composition, temperature, and density* of the gas.

$$\alpha = \kappa \rho$$ where $\rho$ is the gas density and $\kappa$ is the [[Mass Absorption Coefficient]]; $[\kappa] = [m^2 \, kg^{-1}]$

##### There are 4 types of opacity interactions:
[[Bound-Bound Transitions]]
[[Bound-Free Transitions]]
[[Free-Free Transitions]]
[[Scattering]] of photons
