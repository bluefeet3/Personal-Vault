When a material is placed in a [[Magnetic Field]], the medium is **magnetised**. This magnetisation is described by a vector $\vec{M}$, the **dipole moment** per unit volume.

$$\vec{M} = \chi \vec{B}$$ where $\chi$ is the [[Magnetic Susceptibility]] of the medium.

```ad-danger
title: Assumptions
Note that M being proportional to B, the external field, is an assumption. This doen't fully hold for *ferromagnetic* materials.

## Three types of magnetic response in a crystal:
[[Diamagnetism]] -> Negative susceptibility, non-magnetic

[[Paramagnetism]] -> Some organisation in the presence of an external field

[[Ferromagnetism]] -> Always organised
