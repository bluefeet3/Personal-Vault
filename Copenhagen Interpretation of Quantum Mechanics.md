The statistical interpretation (Born) gives the probability of finding a particle between  
a and b, at time t as: $$\int_a^b |\Psi (x,t)|^2dx$$The statistical interpretation introduces some **indeterminacy**, you cannot predict  
with certainty the result of a measurement.

##### Copenhagen Interpretation
Before the measurement the particle was not really anywhere, the *measurement forces the particle to be somewhere*.
The **act of measurement** plays a crucial role in this interpretation of QM.

Whichever position is adopted, a repeated measurement will give you the same value of the position.

### The EPR Paradox
The problem of non-locality. Information travelling faster than the speed of light.

By knowing the spin of one particle, the wavefunction collapses and the spin of the other particle is known.

This was what Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) termed “spooky action-at-a-distance”, which violates the [[Principle of Locality]]. *No influence can propagate faster than the speed of light.*
