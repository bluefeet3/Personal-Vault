The free electron model is a model used to describe the behaviour of electrons in a metal. It is based on the following assumptions:

# Assumptions

1.  The [[Valence Electrons]] are free to move throughout the metal, and they are not bound to any particular atom.
2.  The electrons are able to interact with each other and with the metal atoms, but these interactions are relatively weak compared to the kinetic energy of the electrons. Hence, electron-electron repulsion is ignored.
3.  The charge from the positive ions is represented as a uniform positive background.

These assumptions allow the free electron model to describe the behaviour of electrons in a metal in a simplified manner. However, it should be noted that the free electron model is not a completely accurate description of the behaviour of electrons in a metal, and more advanced models are needed to fully understand the behaviour of electrons in metals.
