Although stars below $0.08 \,\text{M}_\odot$ can't burn hydrogen, they can still generate some luminosity from the burning of deuterium.
- [[Brown Dwarfs]] have surface temperatures of ~1000 K to 2000 K.
- The lower limit between brown dwarfs and planets is defined at $0.015\,\text{M}_\odot$, the minimum mass for burning deuterium.
