AThe evolution of stars is a **cyclic process**. A star is formed out of gas and dust that exists across space known as [[The Interstellar Medium]] (ISM). During a star's lifetime, much of that material may be returned to the ISM through [[Solar Wind|stellar winds]] and explosive events. Hence to understand the evolution of a star, it is important to study the nature of the ISM.

# The Formation of Protostars

[[Protostar|Protostars]] are **pre-nuclear-burning** objects formed from **interstellar molecular clouds**. These clouds must collapse down to create stars. This poses the question: What conditions must exist for collapse to occur?

## The Jeans Criterion
The [[Virial Theorem]] can be used to estimate the conditions necessary for **protostellar collapse**. If twice the kinetic energy of the molecules in the cloud exceeds the gravitational potential energy the cloud will expand. If the other way around, the cloud will collapse.

This gives rise to the [[Jeans Mass]], $M_J$, and the [[Jeans Length]], $R_J$.$$M_J \simeq \left({5kT\over G\mu m_H}\right)^{3\over2}\left(3\over4\pi\rho_0\right)^{1\over2}$$and$$R_J \simeq \left(15kT\over4\pi G\mu m_H \rho_0\right)^{1\over2}$$where $p_0$ is the cloud density, $k$ is the [[Boltzmann Constant]], $T$ is temperature, $G$ is the [[Universal Gravitational Constant]], $\mu$ is the [[Mean Molecular Weight]] and $m_H$ is the mass of [[Hydrogen]]. Both of these are derived in section 12.2 of Carroll and Ostlie on *The Interstellar Medium and Star Formation*.

These are respectively:
- The minimum mass to initiate the spontaneous collapse of the cloud.
- The minimum radius to initiate the spontaneous collapse of the cloud.

```ad-note
title: Assumptions in the derivation
The Jeans mass derivation referenced neglects the fact that there must exist an external pressure on the cloud due to the surrounding interstellar medium.

Although we will not derive the expression here, the critical mass including this is given by the **Bonnor-Ebert mass**.
