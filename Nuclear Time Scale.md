### The Nuclear Time Scale (Essentially Lifetime)
The time in which a star radiates away all the energy that can be released by nuclear reactions.

Around 0.7% of the rest mass is transformed into energy in the burning of hydrogen. $$t_n \approx \frac{0.007 \times 0.1 Mc^2}{L}$$ For the Sun, $t_n = 10^{10}$ years, hence: $$t_n \approx \frac{M/M_\odot}{L/L_\odot} \times 10^{10}$$
As $L \propto M^{3.5}$, **high mass stars** have a lower $t_n$ , *They burn up quickly*.
