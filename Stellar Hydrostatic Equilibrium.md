### Hydrostatic Equilibrium
Stars are **stable structures** and changes aren't observed.

There is a mechanical equilibrium in stars known as Hydrostatic Equilibrium.

##### Assumptions:
Stars are:
$\quad$- Made of gas
$\quad$- Not rotating
$\quad$- Without magnetic fields
$\quad$- Isolated (no binary+)

Hence the only forces acting are due to gravity and pressure.

The full derivation is here: [[Hydrostatic Equilibrium Derivation (STAR)]].

This gives us the first equation of the stellar structure.
$$\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{\rho(r)\,Gm(r)}{r^2}$$
##### Mass Continuity
$$\frac{dm}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho(r)$$
