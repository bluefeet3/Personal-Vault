Two physical [[Observables]] are said to be compatible if the [[Operator|operators]] have a **common set** of [[Eigenvector|Eigenfunctions]].

So that if one quantity is measured, a subsequent measurement of the other quantity will have a completely predictable result and will leave the wave function unchanged.

**Operators representing compatible measurements commute**
