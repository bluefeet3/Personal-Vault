### The Reciprocal Lattice
Real lattice points correspond to the location of real objections and have dimensions $L$.

Reciprocal lattice points are more abstract with dimensions $L^{-1}$.

```ad-info
title: Convention
The reciprical lattice vector is $2\pi$ times the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. (Crystallographers often don't bother with the $2\pi$ but we always use it in Solid-State Physics) 
```

We can relate the real lattice to the reciprocal lattice using the [[Fourier Transform]].

### Brillouin Zones
We define the Brillouin Zone as the boundary in the reciprocal lattice *where scattering will occur*.

The zone is a primitive unit cell in reciprocal space and a [[Wigner-Seitz Cell]] in real space.
It describes the behaviour of the entire crystal.
