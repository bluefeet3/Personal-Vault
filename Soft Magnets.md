# What is a Soft Magnetic Material
A type of magnetic material which can be *easily magnetised and demagnetised* is known as soft magnetic material. The soft magnetic materials have low value of coercivity and high value of permeability.

## Properties
- Low [[Coercivity]]
- High [[Permeability]]
- The area of the [[Hysteresis Loop]] is small.
- Generally high [[Resistivity]]
- Low [[Eddy Current Loss]]
- Suitable for making magnetic circuits.
