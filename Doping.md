Doping of materials to *change their properties* - e.g. to increase electrical conduction in a semiconductor such as silicon - is technologically very important.

Doping to **add electrons** is called "n-type" doping.

Doping to **remove electrons** is called "p-type" doping

When used in conjunction these can form a [[PN Junction]] the building block of modern electronics.
