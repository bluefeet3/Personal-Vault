What is the (classical) [[Drude Model]] - how does it explain conductivity?
Outline the assumptions for the free electron theory model. Calculate relaxation times, current and related effects as per free electron description of Ohm's Law.
Outline what plasmons are, and how the Drude model can successfully estimate their frequency.

### The Free Electron Model
##### - Assumptions

All [[Valence Electrons]] are **free to move** which leave behind positively charged ion cores.

The charge from the positive ions is represented as a uniform positive background.

Electron-Electron repulsion is ignored. All electrons are treated as independent particles.

### The Drude Model
The [[Free Electron Model]] is a combination of the [[Drude Model]] with quantum mechanical [[Fermi-Dirac Statistics]]. It is also known as the Drude-Sommerfeld model.

### Ohm's Law
The electrical conductivity $\sigma$ of a metal is defined as: $$\sigma = \frac{1}{\rho}$$ the inverse of resistivity, $$\sigma = \frac{J}{E}$$ where E is the electric field: $$E = \frac{V}{d}$$ and J the current density: $$J = \frac{I}{A}$$
The average distance an electron travels between collisions is the [[Mean Free Path]], $\lambda$.
