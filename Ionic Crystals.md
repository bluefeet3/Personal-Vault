Derive an expression for the total lattice energy of 2N ions.
What is the importance of the Madelung constant? Calculate the cohesive energy for ionic lattices.

##### Labelling Electrons in atoms

[[Quantum Number]]:
According to the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]], no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers in the same atom.

'Filing' orbitals in the same energy level with one electron each before pairing up any electrons. 
This is known as [[Hund’s Rules]].

**What order do I fill the levels in?** [[The Aufbau Principle]] states that when predicting an atoms ground state electron configuration, electrons will occupy the lowest energy orbital available first.

##### Electrostatic or Madelung Energy
The **long-range interaction** between ions with charge ±q is the electrostatic interaction $\pm \frac{q^2}{r}$, attractive between ions of opposite charge and repulsive between ions of the same charge.
The ions arrange themselves in whatever crystal structure gives the *strongest attractive interaction compatible with the repulsive interaction* at short distances between ion cores.

The repulsive interactions between ions with inert gas configurations are similar to those between inert gas atoms.

The [[Van der Waals-London Interaction|Van der Waals]] part of the attractive interaction in ionic crystals makes a relatively small contribution to the cohesive energy in ionic crystals, of the order of 1 or 2 percent. 

The **main contribution** to the binding energy of ionic crystals is electrostatic and is called the [[Madelung energy]].

##### Total Lattice Energy

Derived from page 24 of the notes:
The total lattice energy of the crystal of 2N ions at their equilibrium separation $R_0$ may be written as:
$$\Delta U_{Total} = -\frac{N\alpha q^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 R_0} \left( 1-\frac{\rho}{R_0} \right)$$
The definition of the Madelung constant $\alpha$ is:
$$\alpha = \sum_{j}' \frac{(\pm)}{p_{ij}}$$
