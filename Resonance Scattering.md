A photon is absorbed by an atom and excited an electron to a higher energy level. This is then followed by a deexcitation of the bound electron to the *same initial level*.
This emits a photon.

This process is **considered [[Scattering]]** as the incoming photon has the same energy as the outgoing photon.

Variations of this scattering exist where higher energy photons are replaced by multiple lower energy photons.
