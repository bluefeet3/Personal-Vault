_Conventionally_, a semiconductor crystal with donor impurities is said to beÂ **n-Type**, as there is an excess concentration of negatively charged carriers. (Electrons in the conduction band)

All states in the valence band are full. There is no flexibility to make new states, but the energy of all the states is slightly changed.
The spare electron goes to the conduction band and is either:

##### Ionised:
The electron is far away from the impure atom.

##### Bound:
Electron next to the impure atom. Lower energy
