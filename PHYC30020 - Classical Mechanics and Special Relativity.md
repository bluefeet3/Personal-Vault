# Classical Mechanics and Special Relativity

#### Notable Books
Classical Mechanics - David Morin
Introduction to Special Relativity - Rindler

Dr Mitchel's Physics Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCow09jTr1HwgynLTcbzVyqg

## Exam - 21/12/22
2 hour exam

There will be one question requiring a calculator.


### Exam Technique
**Budget your time**, spend roughly 30 minutes on each question.
Answer all techniques.

If you can't finish a question, there are marks going for **explaining what you would do**.

Make sure to **comment each step** of your answer.

Explicitly **write out each formula**.

**Think critically** about the answer that you get, is it a sensible answer?
- Dimensional analysis
- If you know the answer is wrong, say why.
- Limits

Don't write too much.

## Four Questions

### Question One - Lagrangian Mechanics
Non-relativistic, classical physics.

Given a system, treat everything as point-like particles.
Write down the Lagrangian, what are the generalised coordinates.

Learn off the Euler Lagrange equation of motion, definition of generalised momentum.

Find the acceleration of the particle.

Interpreting physically what is going on.

### Question Two - Hamiltonian Mechanics
Non-relativistic, classical physics.

Note that the Hamiltonian is the **classical Hamiltonian**.

#### What to learn
- Legendre Transformation
- Formulate the Hamiltonian in terms of the generalised coordinates and generalised momenta. (Remove $\dot{q}$)
- Know and know how to use Hamilton's Equations of Motion.
- When is the Hamiltonian equal to the total energy. When is it conserved.
- Phase Space

No Louisville theorem.

### Question Three - Relativistic Kinematics
- Length contraction
- Time dilation
- Different reference frames
- Events
- Lorentz Transformations
- Space-time interval
- Causality

Note to remember what happens at the limit.
Taylor series expansions.

### Question Four - Four-Vectors
Read over summery sheet.
Mainly to do with notation.

Generalised inner product
- Conserved quantities

Lorentz transformation
Einstein summation notation
