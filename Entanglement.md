In an **entangled state** - a two particle state that cannot be expressed as the product of two one particle states, so that it does note really make  sense to talk to "the state" of either particle separately.

Bell showed (1964) that it made an observable difference which of these two positions was taken and that any local hidden variable theory is incompatible with QM. He did this by generalising the EPR experiment so that two detectors are not orientated along the same direction.

Bell proposed to calculate the *average value* of the product of the spins: $P(a,b)$
