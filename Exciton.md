An exciton is  a bound [[Electron]] and [[Holes|Hole]] pair, bound due to their coulombic attraction. The radius of which is large compared to the atomic spacing. They are weakly bound.

The Exciton can move through the crystal and **transport energy**, but it **does not transport charge**.

There is an inverse relation between the excitonic radius and the excitonic binding energy.
