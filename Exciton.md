An exciton is  a bound [[Electron]] and [[Holes|Hole]] pair, bound due to their coulombic attraction. The radius of which is large compared to the atomic spacing. They are weakly bound.

The Exciton can move through the crystal and **transport energy**, but it **does not transport charge**.

There is an inverse relation between the excitonic radius and the excitonic binding energy.

### Exciton Types
There are two types of excitons:

#### Wannier (Mott) Exciton
Extends over many unit cells.

Binding energy $\approx 10 \,\text{meV}$
Radius $\approx 100 \,\text{Angstroms}$


#### Frenkel Exciton
Localised to a few unit cells and hence, delocalised in k-space.

Binding Energy $\approx 1 \,\text{eV}$
Radius $\approx 10 \,\text{Angstroms}$
