### The Thermal Time Scale
The time in which a star would radiate all its thermal energy if the **nuclear reactions stopped**.
It is also the time it takes for radiation from the centre to reach the surface.

As per the [[Virial Theorem]], the kinetic energy of the thermal motion of gas particles is half the potential energy, hence, the thermal time scale can be roughly estimated as: $$t_t \approx \frac{0.5 G M^2}{R L}$$$$t_t \approx \frac{(M/M_\odot)^2}{(R/R_\odot)(L/L_\odot)} \times 2\times10^7 \,\text{years}$$ where R is the stellar radius.
