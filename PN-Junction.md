Fundamental building block for modern electronics.

#### With no applied voltage:
Bound charges are **attracted** by free electrons and holes in the p-type and n-type semiconductors.

[[The Depletion Zone]] forms as **diffusion** occurs and *free electrons recombine with holes*.
The "uncovered" bound charges effect a **voltage differential** across the depletion zone. The magnitude of this barrier voltage grows as diffusion continues.

Equilibrium is reached and diffusion ceases, there is **no net flow**.

If the whole system is in equilibrium, the the **Fermi level must be constant** throughout the entire volume of the two blocks. This requires that valence and conduction bands must become bent in the region of the junction. This situation is illustrated below:![[constantFermi.png]]

## Forward and Reverse Bias
##### Unbiased:
Built-in voltage is due to "space charge" layers which prevent electrons and holes from diffusing further.

##### Forward Bias
If a **positive voltage** is applied across the pn-junction, the potential barrier is reduced, hence a current can flow.

The depletion region shrinks.

##### Reverse Bias
If a **negative voltage** is applied across the pn-junction, the potential barrier is increased, hence current cannot flow.

The current is greatly reduced.

## Shockley / Ideal Diode Equation
$$I = I_0 \left( \exp{\left(\frac{qV}{nkT}\right)} - 1 \right)$$ where $I_0$ is the total generation current due to both electrons and holes.

In general, $n$ is a fitting parameter that allows for measured departure of diode IV characteristics from the ideal Shockley equation.

## Depletion-Layer Width
PN-junctions are usually highly asymmetrical in doping concentration.
