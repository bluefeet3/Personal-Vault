*Learning Plan*
Inter-band absorption processes, Direct and Indirect absorption, the Bohr Model, Free Excitons at high densities, devices, polaron and metal insulator transitions.

## Optical Classification
There are three primary ways to describe the [[Optical Quality]] of a material. (Note colour will be discussed elsewhere)

**Transparent:** You can see through it, although colour may change.
$\quad$- Glass
$\quad$- Insulators
$\quad$- Some semiconductors

These materials have little absorption or reflection.

**Translucent:** Light is transmitted diffusely (internal scattering), usually related to defects such as grain boundaries or pores.
$\quad$- Poly-crystalline insulators

**Opaque:** You can't see through it.
$\quad$- Bulk metals
$\quad$- Some semiconductors

These materials absorb and reflect light.

## Band Structure of Materials
Recall: In a solid, there are so many orbitals tat they form continuous band.

Photons can transfer their energy to electrons, or vice versa. Optics can hence tell us about band structure, or band structure about the optical response.
