### The Free-Fall Time Scale
The time it would take for a star to collapse if the **internal pressure were removed**.

Note: This is the shortest time scale.

It can be estimated from the time it would take a particle to fall freely from the stellar surface to the centre. This is half the period. $$t_d = \frac{2\pi}{2}\sqrt{\frac{(R/2)^3}{GM}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{GM}}$$
